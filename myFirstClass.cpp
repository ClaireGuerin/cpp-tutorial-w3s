// C++ is Object Oriented Programming

/* Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

  - OOP is faster and easier to execute
  - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
  - OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
  - OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time */
